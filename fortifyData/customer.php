                    <h2>SMB</h2>
                    <a>We belive that all business of all sizes deserve to be protected from cyber crime.
                        And when randsomware strikes it can not only disrupt your business,
                        it could be an event your business cannot recover from.

                    <a>- Prioritize your spending on your limited IT budget, and help ensure you are
                        as protected from cyber crime as possible.</a> </br>
                    <a>- Ensure compliance with SOC2, PCI and other regulatory frameworks required of your business.
                        And when it's time for an audit, reduce the cost of the audit by already having your house
                        in order. </a> </br>

                        as new threats emerge.</a> </br>
                    <a>- Reduce insurance premiums by showing cyber liability underwriters that you are in control
                        of your IT infrastructure and have a strong risk management program in place.</a>

                    <h2>Enterprise</h2>
                    <a>In large organizations, communication between the business and IT is critical. No where is this more true than with cyber security.
                        By using FortifyData as your cyber risk management platform, you are helping ensure there's a strong bridge of communication. </a> </br>
                    <a>GRC solutions automate spreadsheets, which saves time, but inherently does not discover blind spots. You cannot protect the system you didn't know about.
                        FortifyData integrates asset discovery with a collaboration system providing a single system for your CISO, or IT security team, to use to ensure the business knows
                        what it's exposure to attack is. </a> </br>
                    <a>Like all businesses compliance is a burden. That burden is lessoned by having a single platform with included compliance frameworks.
                        By using FortifyData as your cyber risk management platform, you can reduce spend on compliance by as much as 50%.</a>
